#This repository have collection of C programming

#The File structure is divided into menu.c where the main function executed. 

#Currently it have multiple sections and each sections sub routines are implemented in its respective files.

#For e.g 
#menu.c  ---> Basic.c and Array.c

#menu.h ---> It have the header defnitions and global routine function calls.

#For e.g if the devloper wants to add a new section called string. create a new file string.c and string.h and use the extern functions in menu.c to linking.
